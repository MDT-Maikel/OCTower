RoomMenuInformationEntry1=Some of the rooms have a joker, you can use it to skip a room you were not able to complete yet.
RoomMenuInformationEntry2=Most of the rooms have an ancient tablet, you need these to progress, so collect them all.
RoomMenuInformationEntry3=You gain a tablet or joker when you collect it and bring either to the room entrance or exit.
